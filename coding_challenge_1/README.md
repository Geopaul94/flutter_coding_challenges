# Flutter Coding Challenge #1

Welcome to the first Flutter coding challenge! This challenge will test your ability to build user
interfaces (UI) with gradients using Flutter.

## Environment

* Platform: Web (testing widgets only works with web rendering currently)
* Restrictions
    * Do not modify the `lib/main.dart` file
  * Leave the `lib/src/` folder untouched

## Task

Your objective is to recreate the UI provided in the Figma design

## Where to start?
* Edit the `lib/start_widget.dart` file. You can create additional files as needed.

## Testing and Submission:

Once you've completed the UI recreation, use the provided button to test your solution. If it
functions correctly, submit your code as the answer on the coding challenge
page:  https://www.servusflutter.com/challenges

## Additional Tips:

* Feel free to create as many helper files as needed to organize your code.
* Refer to the Flutter documentation (https://flutter.dev/docs) for assistance with building UIs.
* Good luck and have fun!
